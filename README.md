**Acetylcholinesterase (AChE)** is an enzyme critical for nervous system function. It breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) into choline and acetate, terminating the signal transmission at cholinergic synapses. This process is essential for proper muscle function and nerve signaling.

AChE is a target in drug discovery for neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. AChE inhibitors are used to increase acetylcholine levels in the brain, improving memory and cognitive function.

Molecular docking and descriptor-based computational techniques, like using PaDEL-Descriptor, are often used to design inhibitors.

Here, PaDEL-Descriptor is used for generating molecular descriptors which is a foundation for QSAR modeling.  PubChem Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular fingerprint used to encode chemical structures into binary vectors, are used. These vectors represent the presence or absence of specific substructures or chemical features in a molecule.
